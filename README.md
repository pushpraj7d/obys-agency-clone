# Obys Agency Clone ðŸŽ¨

This is my first animation-focused website project built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and animation libraries like **GSAP**, **Shery.js**, **Locomotive.js**, and **Textile.js**.  
Inspired by the design and interaction of [Obys Agency](https://obys.agency/), this project was a hands-on exercise to learn modern front-end animation techniques.
